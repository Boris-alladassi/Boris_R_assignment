# Review of Boris_R_assignment by Grant Nickles

Before running the code I inspected for HTML document and file organization. It is very well organized, I liked that you had folders for Maize and Teosinte to keep the repository clean. He also had very nice documentation and made use of the R markdown file my using headers and explanations for his code.  The data visualization was very well done. I was impressed by the density plot. I hadn't thought of separating out the chromosomes to allow for easier visual inspection on my project, but I think doing so provides more information. This was very smart and I liked how you add small details like coloring the graphs. Your own visualization was a very cool graph. Provides some interesting information about the standardized proportion of the distinct genotypes. I was really impressed with the circular graph you made. Nice work Mahule! I learned a lot from going over your project that I would incorporate in my own projects in the future.  

## Running of the code on my own computer

Before running his code I set the working directory to the repository.

**Data Inspection**

Your code for the data inspection was fine, but you could have provided a bit more detail on your takeaways from doing this inspection. However, looks good to me.

**Data Processing**

He cut out the data he didn't need, and merged together the files with the SNP file after separating out the maize and teosinte groups. He then formatted the files by changing the ? to - for the decreasing files. 

**File creation**

I hadn't thought of using the paste function to make dynamic file names that change with the for loop. That was pretty smart. He also made a loop that created all 40 files. Very clean way to do it. My own super picky comment is the files are automatically put into the main repository folder and not the maize and teosinte folders. However, this is so minor it doesn't really matter. One can go in later and manually move the files to there proper locations. 

**Data Visualization**

This was where I was most impressed with your work. I had minimal R experience prior to this project so I'm learning a lot as I go. Looking how you created your plots taught me a lot about how I could have done mine. They all look very clean, and you included every plot the rubric asked for. Really great job! I don't have any critics on this work. Especially on your personal graphs, I had never even seen the geom-bar plot as a circular graph before. I'm assuming this was done with the coord_polar() command. **Everything ran fine on my computer!**

Before pushing the request back I deleted all the intermediate files the R script created. I am just going to push this R markdown file. Overall I'd give this project a perfect score. He did a great job.
